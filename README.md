# Nand-To-Tetris
"Nand" is the name of the most elementary logic gate from which computers are normally built, and "Tetris" is the name of a mythological computer game.
We start with Nand gates, and gradually build the chipset and hardware platform of a simple computer system called Hack, as well as an assembler.

Project 1: Building elementary logic gates like And, Or, Not, Multiplexor, and more

Project 2: Building a family of adder chips, culminating in the construction of an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)

Project 3: Building registers and memory units, culminating in the construction of a Random Access Memory (RAM)

Project 4: Learning a machine language and using it to write some illustrative low-level programs

Project 5: Using the chipset built in projects 1-3 to build a Central Processing Unit (CPU) and a hardware platform capable of executing programs written in the machine language introduced in project 4

Project 6: Developing an assembler, i.e. a capability to translate programs written in symbolic machine language into binary, executable code.
